> [!WARNING]
> - `Knife Reach` is unstable and will not work in some game sessions.
> - `NoClip` removes collision for ALL entities, this means:
>   -	You risk falling through the map if you're not careful.
>   -	You can go outside during prep phase. Use `Go Outside` to avoid dying.
>   -	Drones, grenades, and the defuser will fall through the map. This means if you plant with `NoClip` on, it causes instant round loss.

> [!IMPORTANT]
